# 311-translation

This is a repository to track development of a new translation model for service requests through Boston 311. Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/monum/311-translation/wiki) to get a better understanding how we implemeneted the different models by training it over Local data to get better translations.

The ideal outcome of this project is:

- The creation of new, accurate bi-directional machine translation models for English - Spanish, and English - Vietnamese focused on grievance data.
